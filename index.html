        <p class="pc">Dear President Englert,</p>
        <p>
          Today I am writing to you as a Temple Alumni, a fellow Owl, and a fellow privileged white male.<br>
          It was May 11th, 2019, when I sat in one of the rows of cherry chairs lined up for the 154 Commencement of
          Temple
          University. Together with over 10,000 other graduates of the class of 2019, I walked into the Liacouras
          Center,
          its stands filled with all our loved ones. The air filled with an electrifying sense of excitement, relief,
          and
          pride. After four transforming years in the heart of Philadelphia, I sat under the massive banners honoring
          the
          great teams and players of our University's 123-year-old basketball program. Moved and emotional did I reflect
          on
          my time at Temple and listened to the incredibly powerful words of student speaker Vanessa Gabrielle Chandler.
          Electrified by her speech, “[our] class of owls [was] spreading our wings, taking flight and taking this world
          by
          storm.” Wearing the Temple T on my gown I received my diploma and for the rest of my life became a Temple
          alumnus.
          God, did I wear that letter proudly that day.
        </p>
        <p class="pc">
          That was 394 days ago. Yesterday, on my morning run I put on, as always, a grey long sleeve with the big white
          Temple T. Today, I did not. Let me tell you why.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I read the tweets of the University’s official twitter account yesterday morning, I was confused at
          first.
          Why did Temple find it necessary to state that we “respect the first amendment rights of all, including these
          that
          express unpopular and hateful speech.” Why did the account then have to seemingly reassure us that we “do not
          tolerate racism within the community”? I did some research and educated myself on the issue. As I found out
          more
          about what was happening, that some fellow owls used racist slurs, my confusion turned into anger and
          alienation
          first. I would even say that for those first moments, I felt ashamed for being a Temple Owl. However, in the
          classrooms of Gladfelter and Fox, I learned to use my voice, to call out and address the issues that I see.
          Freshman year, my HR professor made us sign every test we handed in. Putting our signature on that sheet of
          paper
          and associating it with our name made us realize that this test was important. That the words on it mattered.
          It
          should ensure that we put thought and effort into our responses. My name will forever be associated with
          Temple
          University. And those tweets lacked both the thought and empathy that I expect from myself and the
          organizations I
          am associated with.
        </p>
        <p>
          emple prides itself on being committed to building a diverse educational community, appreciation of others,
          open-mindedness, and respect. It claims that its policies, practices, and programs exemplify our commitment.
          Publicly reinforcing that "Temple respects the first amendment rights of all, including those that express
          unpopular and even hateful speech that is antithetical to the university's mission” is contrary to all these
          claims. Do not get me wrong, freedom of speech is one of the highest goods in a democracy and we should always
          make it a priority to protect it. However, the freedom to voice your views freely is not equal to the freedom
          to
          voice your views free of all consequences. As an institution that prides itself as being diverse and committed
          to
          providing an environment of inclusion, you have to actively take a stand against racism. There is no middle
          ground
          when it comes to racism. Here are some powerful words by Ibram Kendi that describe the issue perfectly:
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <quote>
            “What’s the problem with being “not racist”? It is a claim that signifies neutrality: “I am not a racist,
            but
            neither am I aggressively against racism.” But there is no neutrality in the racism struggle. The opposite
            of
            “racist” isn’t “not racist.” It is “antiracist.”
          </quote>
          <p>Ibram X. Kendi, How to Be an Antiracist</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          By taking the time to highlight freedom of speech Temple seems to position itself as not-racist, instead of
          anti-racist. Then, following up this tweet by stating that "recognizing everyone’s First Amendment rights does
          not
          mean that Temple tolerates racism", seemingly lecturing outraged students, alumni, and antiracist owls in a
          tweet
          of 265 characters is not a worthy response.
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
          <quote>
            Respect for others requires a complicated calculation in which one party agrees to moderate their own
            desires to
            consider the long-term consequences of their own behavior, to think about something other than the thing
            right
            in front of them.

        <p>
          If I imagine the disappointment and betrayal I felt as a privileged white male alumnus I cannot imagine how
          our
          students and alumni of color, our students, and alumni that are gay or transsexual have felt. We proudly claim
          to
          be a safe space and place of inclusion. A place where people come together and minorities are celebrated in
          their
          diversity. How can we say that when you fail to stand up for them when they need it most.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now it is the time to speak up and make known that we are anti-racists, as individuals, as institutions, as
          students, as professors, as deans, as presidents, as students, as alumni, as Temple Owls. You need to address this issue appropriately and
          sincerely, and not let a 265 character long tweet be the only communication. We all deserve better.
